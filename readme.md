Eliza Chatbot!

This is my Eliza chatbot! This chatbot was build for my third year project for Data Representation and Querying in GMIT. We had to build a simple chatbot in GoLang.


Whats Eliza?

ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum. It was created to demonstrate the superficiality of communication between man and machine, Eliza simulated conversation by using a 'pattern matching' and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program. For more information go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA


How to Run

You can use this chatbot by cloning the repository. You can then run the program by directing the command line to the folder it's in and typing this into the terminal

go run eliza.go

The webpage is now served to the local host. To view the webapp , open the browser and enter this in the url bar

localhost:8080
